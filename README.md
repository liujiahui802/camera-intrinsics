# Traning 
python train.py â€”data_dir=/opt/meituan/cephfs/user/hadoop-wallepnc/lixin/data/kitti/format_data_3 --checkpoint_dir=./log/2019-08-26


The --data_dir is the processed data directory where the training data (in Struct2depth's format) is stored. The data_example folder contains a single training example expressed in this format.

The chechpoint_dir is where the trained model will be saved or the model to be resume training process.
